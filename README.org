* Sync that package manager with my dotfiles

We want to  (un)install packages (be it with apt,  pip, npm…) and save
them in some dotfiles, in one single command.

Basic usage: typing

: meminstall foo

will install package =foo= with the system package manager (like =apt=).

To install a package with =pip= (globally):

: meminstall --pm pip foo

and to remove it:

: meminstall --pm pip foo --rm


We can add a message with =-m=. It will be appended on the same line:

: meminstall --pm pip foo -m "foo does bar"


We can edit  the list of packages for that  package maneger before the
operations with =-e= (=--editor=):

: meminstall --pm pip foo --rm -e

So, recommended aliases:

: alias rpip="meminstall --pm pip"

* Develop
: pip install -e .
* TODOs and ideas

- auto-recognize a virtualenv
- undo last action
- shall we define only a relation  package manager -> file or whatever
  -> package manager -> file. This would  allow to split our config in
  many files (to have "mao.txt", "music.txt"…).
