* Sync your packages with your dotfiles (and vice versa)

When we use a package manager (be it apt, pip, npm,…), we want to sync
the list of installed packages  in requirement files.  We then declare
a mapping that links a package manager to its requirements file:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
REQUIREMENTS_ROOT_DIR = "~/dotfiles/"
REQUIREMENTS_FILES = {
    "apt": {
        "file": "apt.txt", # => ~/dotfiles/apt.txt
        "pacman": "apt-get",
        "install": "install -y --force-yes",
        "uninstall": "remove",
        },
    # and so on for pip, pip3, gem, npm, docker and guix.
}
#+END_SRC

and we call

: syp --pm apt foo bar

to add the two packages "foo" and "bar" in =~/dotfiles/apt.txt= and at
the same  time, to check if  this list has been  edited manually (with
packages added or removed) and  act accordingly (we make diffs against
the cache at =~/.syp/apt.txt=).

See the Settings section below.

Tested on python 2.7 and 3.4.

** Usage

The basic usage  is to check all of the  package managers, and install
and remove what's necessary:

Example:

: syp

can output:

#+BEGIN_HTML
 <img src="http://i.imgur.com/NXiddZB.png" </img>
#+END_HTML


We set the package manager with  =--pm= and *give one or many packages
to install*:

: syp --pm pip syp foo bar

will   append   "syp",   "foo"   and    "bar"   at   the   bottom   of
=~/dotfiles/pip.txt= (if they are not there yet), check if pip.txt was
manually edited, and suggest a list of packages to install and remove.

So a suggested alias is

: alias sypip="syp --pm pip "

If  no package  manager is  specified, *we  use apt  by default*  (see
Settings below).

To *remove packages*, use =--rm=:

: syp --pm pip foo --rm


We can *add a message* with =-m=. It will be appended on the same line:

: syp --pm pip foo -m "foo is a cool package"


We can *edit  the list* of packages for that  package manager before the
operations with =-e= (=--editor=):

: syp --pm pip foo --rm -e

* Settings

The  default settings  come  with a  configuration  for =apt=,  =pip=,
=pip3=, =gem=, =npm=, =docker= and =guix=.

The user settings, stored at =~/.syp/settings.py=, is a regular python
 file that will  be =exec='ed on startup.   So, if you want  to add or
 overide  a package  manager settings,  edit the  =REQUIREMENTS_FILES=
 dictionnary  accordingly. Only the key "file" is required:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
REQUIREMENTS_FILES['apt'] = {
    "file": "requirements-apt.txt", # required. appended to REQUIREMENTS_ROOT_DIR
    "pacman": "aptitude",           # by default, same as the package manager name, here 'apt'
    "install": "install -y",        # 'install' by default
    "uninstall": "remove",          # 'uninstall' by default.
}
#+END_SRC

See also
#+BEGIN_SRC python
#: The base directory where lies the configuration files.
REQUIREMENTS_ROOT_DIR = "~/dotfiles/"

#: System package manager, as a default.
SYSTEM_PACMAN = "apt-get"
#+END_SRC

* Develop
: pip install -e .
* Todos and ideas

- auto commit
- auto-recognize a virtualenv ?
- allow for more than a requirement file for one package manager.
- ask all and apply
- more tests

  Bust most of all... use [[https://gnu.org/software/guix/][Guix]] !
